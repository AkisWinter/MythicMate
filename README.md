## Commands

### `/lfm`
Start looking for members for a Mythic+ run.

- **Usage:** `/lfm dungeon:<dungeon> key_level:<key level> role:<role>`
- **Example:** `/lfm dungeon:mots key_level:+10 role:tank`

This command creates an interactive embed where others can join by reacting to select their role (Tank, Healer, DPS). Once all roles are filled, the bot marks the group as ready.
